## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. This process ensures that the development team fully understands what the system is supposed to do before any design or coding begins.

### 🧠 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

- **Clarity & Alignment**: It bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding what the software should achieve.
- **Prevents Scope Creep**: Clearly defined requirements help avoid unnecessary features or last-minute changes that can delay delivery.
- **Cost & Time Efficiency**: Detecting issues at the requirement stage is far cheaper than fixing them during development or after deployment.
- **Improved Quality**: Solid requirements lead to better planning, design, and testing — ultimately improving the overall quality of the final product.
- **Basis for Testing**: Functional and non-functional requirements become the foundation for designing test cases and validating the software.

## ✅ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of software projects. It lays the groundwork for what is to be built, how it should behave, and how success will be measured.

### 1. 🎯 Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement Analysis helps define the boundaries of a project. It ensures that all stakeholders—clients, developers, testers, and managers—have a shared understanding of what the software will and won't do, reducing misunderstandings and scope creep.

### 2. 💰 Saves Time and Resources
By identifying potential issues early in the development cycle, requirement analysis helps avoid costly rework, delays, or complete project failures. Proper analysis leads to more accurate time estimates, budgeting, and resource allocation.

### 3. 🧪 Foundation for Design and Testing
Requirements serve as a blueprint for both system design and quality assurance. Well-defined functional and non-functional requirements allow teams to create better architecture, write targeted test cases, and ensure the software performs as expected.

## 🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure software meets user needs and project goals. Below are the five key activities:

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**
  - Involves collecting information from stakeholders, users, and existing systems.
  - Focuses on understanding the problems, needs, and expectations from the software.

- **🧠 Requirement Elicitation**
  - Uses techniques like interviews, surveys, brainstorming, and prototyping.
  - Helps uncover implicit needs and refine initial inputs into actionable requirements.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**
  - Converts gathered information into structured documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).
  - Ensures consistency, clarity, and traceability of all requirements.

- **🧮 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Analyzes requirements for feasibility, completeness, and potential conflicts.
  - May include modeling using use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or UML to visualize system behavior.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**
  - Confirms that documented requirements align with stakeholder needs and are realistic and testable.
  - Involves reviews, walkthroughs, and approval from stakeholders to prevent future misunderstandings.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional**. Understanding the difference is key to building systems that not only work but work well.

### ✅ Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific behaviors, functions, and features it must support.

**Definition:**  
These are the core services and operations the system must perform to meet user needs.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users must be able to create, view, edit, and cancel bookings.
- The system should allow users to filter bookings by date, status, or customer.
- Admin users should receive notifications for every new booking.
- The system must generate invoices upon successful booking.
- Customers should receive confirmation emails after making a booking.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** — the qualities and constraints like speed, security, and scalability.

**Definition:**  
These requirements describe the performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes of the system.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- The system should load the dashboard within 2 seconds under normal conditions.
- It must handle up to 1,000 concurrent booking requests.
- Booking data should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime availability.
- All actions should be logged for auditing and compliance purposes.

## 📊 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram used during Requirement Analysis to visually represent the system’s functional requirements. They show how **actors** (users or other systems) interact with the system through **use cases** (specific functionalities or services).

### ✅ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Help clarify system requirements early in development.
- Provide a visual summary of the system’s scope.
- Improve communication between stakeholders and the development team.
- Identify primary user interactions and responsibilities.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance Criteria are a set of conditions or statements that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story or feature and help ensure that the feature delivers value and functions correctly.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

- **Clarifies Requirements**: Ensures developers and stakeholders share a common understanding of what "done" means for a feature.
- **Guides Development**: Helps developers know exactly what functionality and behavior are expected.
- **Improves Testing**: Enables QA teams to create targeted tests and ensures features meet user expectations.
- **Reduces Miscommunication**: Minimizes the risk of rework due to unclear or misunderstood requirements.

### 🛒 Example: Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to be able to check out my booking, so I can confirm and pay for my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ The checkout process must allow selection of a saved or new payment method.
- ✅ The user must see a summary of their booking (dates, location, price) before confirming.
- ✅ The system must validate payment before confirming the booking.
- ✅ A confirmation page and email must be generated upon successful checkout.
- ✅ The system should prevent double bookings by locking the slot during checkout.
